Hey there! I am a sophomore pursuing Btech in Computer science at Amrita University. I find interest in web development, blogging, problem solving, and contributing to open source. Other than the technical stuff, I love playing badminton, sketching and painting and finally singing!

I started my open source contribution when I was a fresher. I started with Libreoffice.
